#Framework for Freescale MK20DX128VLH5 MCU

##Description
This is a hobby approach to establish a framework for freescale MCU's.
The idea behind this is, to use my little Teensy 3.0 board as an indipendent development base.

##Development
*Stage 1: In this early stage all core modules will be implemented.
*Stage 2: Realese Version 0.1
*Stage 3: Implement middleware driver for the core modules like GPIO/SPI/USB.
*Stage 4: Release Version 0.2
